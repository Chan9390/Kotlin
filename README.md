# Kotlin
Sample Android apps I made to learn Kotlin

### MultiActivity
App consists of two activities. Enter name in one and the name will be displayed on second activity on button click. If no name entered toast appears.

### DeviceInfo
App was created to practice scroll view. This app also shows what details of device an app can get without explicit permission. Pretty interesting !
